{"name":"Organizer project","tagline":"In this repository, we will work on the four year planner project","body":"Welcome to our Project Webpage. Our mission is to create an organized four year planner for college students and prevent \"super senior\" semesters or summer courses which many students have to do from lack of proper planning and guidance. We want to assist you in keeping up with all of your major,minor, specialty program, scholarship, and general education requirements. We are continually innovating our prototype to plan a neat 4 year layout for your major, keep track of your total credits, corresponding semester and cumulative GPAs, and general education requirements. This is our first web prototype.\r\n\r\nCheck out the webpage at: ([Organizer Project](http://krish1995.github.io/organizer_project/grade_test.html))\r\nPlease offer suggestions. Thank you","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
