{"name":"Organizer project","tagline":"In this repository, we will work on the four year planner project","body":"Welcome to our Project Webpage. Our mission is to create an organized four year planner for college students to help prevent \"super senior\" semesters and summer courses that many students end up pursuing in order to graduate. Having to pursue these extra semesters is likely due to a lack of proper planning and guidance and/or students' aspiration for educational transdisciplinarity (pursuing double majors, minors, specific programs, and hobby courses). We greatly encourage taking diverse courses to learn multidisciplinary thinking but aspire to mitigate the effects of poor planning. Therefore, our application will allow you to keep up with all of your major,minor, specialty program, scholarship, and general education requirements, offer suggested 4 year plans which you can uniquely modify for yourself, and track your progress through college. We are continually modifying our prototype to reach optimum functionality and user-friendliness. \r\n\r\nCheck out the webpage at: ([Organizer Project](http://krish1995.github.io/organizer_project/grade_test.html))\r\n\r\nPlease offer suggestions.
